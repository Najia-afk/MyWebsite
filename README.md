First, you'll need to find a web hosting provider that offers Unix-based hosting and has support for Flask. There are many web hosting providers that offer these services, so you can do some research to find the one that best suits your needs and budget. For example, some popular providers are DigitalOcean, Vultr, and Linode.

Once you've chosen a web hosting provider, you'll need to sign up for an account and set up a server. This will typically involve selecting the type of server you want (e.g. Linux, FreeBSD, etc.), choosing a server location, and selecting a pricing plan. The exact steps will vary depending on the provider you choose, so you'll need to follow their instructions to set up your server.

Once your server is set up, you'll need to connect to it using ssh. You can do this using a command like the following:

Copy code
ssh username@server_ip_address
Replace username with your server's username and server_ip_address with the IP address of your server.

Once you're logged in to your server, you'll need to install Flask and the other dependencies for your app. You can do this using the pip command. For example, if you're using Python 3, you can use the following command:
Copy code
pip3 install flask requests web3
This will install the Flask, requests, and web3 libraries on your server.

Next, you'll need to upload your Flask app to the server. You can do this using the scp command. For example, if your app is called app.py and it's in the current directory on your local machine, you can use the following command to copy it to the server:
Copy code
scp app.py username@server_ip_address:/var/www/html/
Replace username with your server's username and server_ip_address with the IP address of your server. This will copy the app.py file to the /var/www/html directory on the server.

Once your Flask app is on the server, you can start it by running the following command:
Copy code
python3 app.py
This will start the Flask app on the server, and it will be available at the http://server_ip_address:5000 URL, where server_ip_address is the IP address of your server.

To enable HTTPS for your Flask app, you'll need to generate a SSL/TLS certificate and key for your server. You can use the openssl command to do this. For example, you can use the following commands to generate a self-signed certificate and key:
Copy code
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=My Company/CN=myserver" -keyout myserver.key -out myserver.crt
This will generate two files: myserver.crt and myserver.key, which are the certificate and key files, respectively.

Next, you'll need to configure your Flask app to use the SSL/
