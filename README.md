Flask app setup on Unix server
To set up your Flask app on a Unix server and enable HTTPS for secure communication, follow these steps:

Find a web hosting provider that offers Unix-based hosting and has support for Flask. Some popular providers are DigitalOcean, Vultr, and Linode.

Sign up for an account with your chosen web hosting provider and set up a server.

Connect to your server using ssh. For example:

Copy code
ssh username@server_ip_address
Install Flask and the other dependencies for your app using the pip command. For example:
Copy code
pip3 install flask requests web3
Upload your Flask app to the server using the scp command. For example:
Copy code
scp app.py username@server_ip_address:/var/www/html/
Start your Flask app by running the following command:
Copy code
python3 app.py
Generate a SSL/TLS certificate and key for your server using the openssl command. For example:
Copy code
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=My Company/CN=myserver" -keyout myserver.key -out myserver.crt
Configure your Flask app to use the SSL/TLS certificate and key. For example:
Copy code
app = Flask(__name__)
app.run(ssl_context=('myserver.crt', 'myserver.key'))
Restart your Flask app and access it using the https protocol. For example:
Copy code
https://server_ip_address:5000
