# To set up your Flask app and enable HTTPS, follow these steps:

1. Find a web hosting provider that offers Unix-based hosting and has support for Flask. Some popular providers are DigitalOcean, Vultr, and Linode.

2. Sign up for an account with your chosen web hosting provider and set up a server.

3. Connect to your server using ssh. For example:

```ssh username@server_ip_address```

4. Install Flask and the other dependencies for your app using the pip command. For example:

```pip3 install flask requests web3```

5. Upload your Flask app and HTML files to the server using the scp command. For example:

```scp app.py username@server_ip_address:/var/www/html/```

6. Start your Flask app by running the following command:

```python3 app.py```

7. Generate a SSL/TLS certificate and key for your server using the openssl command. For example:

```openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=My Company/CN=myserver" -keyout myserver.key -out myserver.crt```

8. Configure your Flask app to use the SSL/TLS certificate and key. For example:

```app = Flask(name)```

```app.run(ssl_context=('myserver.crt', 'myserver.key'))```

9. Restart your Flask app and access it using the https protocol. For example:

```https://server_ip_address:5000```

10. To secure your API key, follow these steps:

- Store your API key in a separate file, such as apikey.txt.

- Use secure file permissions to restrict access to the apikey.txt file. This will prevent unauthorized users from reading the API key.

- Use the os.environ object in your Flask app to set the API key as an environment variable. This will prevent the key from being exposed in the source code of your app.

- Use the os.getenv function to read the API key from the environment variable and use it in your app.

- Use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between your Flask app and the client. This will prevent the API key from being exposed in the network traffic.

Your Flask app and HTML files should be placed in the /var/www/html directory on your server. This is the default directory where web server files are stored on an Amazon Linux 2 instance. You can create this directory if it doesn't already exist, and then place your Flask app and HTML files there.

The apikey.txt file should be stored in a secure location on your server. It is recommended to store it outside of the /var/www/html directory, as this directory is accessible to the web server and anyone who has access to the web server files. You can create a separate directory for your sensitive files, such as /var/secrets, and store the apikey.txt file there. Then, use the os.environ object to set the path to the apikey.txt file as an environment variable, and use the os.getenv function to read the API key from the environment variable in your Flask app.
